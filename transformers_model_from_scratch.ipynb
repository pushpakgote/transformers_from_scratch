    "In sequence to sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model.  However, when you train a Transformer network, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:\n",

The sum of the positional encoding and word embeding is ultimately what is fed into the model. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data. Note that while in the lectures Andrew uses vertical vectors but in this assignment, all vectors are horizontal. All matrix multiplications should be adjusted accordingly.\n",
